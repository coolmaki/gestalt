[![itch.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/itch.io-Game_Icon_Pack-FF0B4A?style=for-the-badge&logo=itch.io&logoColor=white&labelColor=272730)](https://nieobie.itch.io/free-icons)

Or download from [**Releases**](https://github.com/Nieobie/game-icon-pack/releases)


## Preview

### Online Preview (GitHub Pages)
The icon pack is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.  
Visit: **https://nieobie.github.io/game-icon-pack** (or this fork's Pages URL: https://cyojkoy.github.io/game-icon-pack/ )

Every push to the `main` branch triggers a new build, so the online preview stays up to date.

### Local Preview

Want to browse and search all icons more easily?

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
node server.js
```

3. Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

> **Note:** The local preview uses the built-in server (`server.js`). For static deployment, the project includes a `scripts/generate-static.js` build script and a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically generates static assets (`data.json` + `svg/`) and deploys them to GitHub Pages.

## Index File

A `Icon_Catalog.json` is provided in the root directory for programmatic retrieval and batch processing or LLM . Each icon entry contains the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| component_name | Icon name (e.g., `sword`, `health-potion`) |
| visual_features | Visual description (shape, color, line style, etc.) |
| use_cases | Suitable scenarios (UI buttons, skill icons, map markers, etc.) |
| synonyms | Synonyms / keywords for search and matching |
| core_semantic | Core abstract meaning the icon conveys |

This JSON file stays updated with the icon pack, making it easy to integrate into your own toolchains or game editors.


## Requests

I can't promise I'll add everything, but I'm always happy to hear ideas for future updates.
